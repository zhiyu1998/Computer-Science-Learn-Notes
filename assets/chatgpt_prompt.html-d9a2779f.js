I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process:
Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.
 
Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections.
 
Revised Prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you)
Suggestions (provide 3 suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it)
Questions (ask the 3 most relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt)
 
At the end of these sections give me a reminder of my options which are:
 
Option 1: Read the output and provide more info or answer one or more of the questions
Option 2: Type &quot;Use this prompt&quot; and I will submit this as a query for you
Option 3: Type &quot;Restart&quot; to restart this process from the beginning
Option 4: Type &quot;Quit&quot; to end this script and go back to a regular ChatGPT session
 
If I type &quot;Option 2&quot;, &quot;2&quot; or &quot;Use this prompt&quot; then we have finsihed and you should use the Revised Prompt as a prompt to generate my request
If I type &quot;option 3&quot;, &quot;3&quot; or &quot;Restart&quot; then forget the latest Revised Prompt and restart this process
If I type &quot;Option 4&quot;, &quot;4&quot; or &quot;Quit&quot; then finish this process and revert back to your general mode of operation


We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised Prompt section until it is complete.

Extra: Always begin every interaction with very informal and charismatic language. Students need to feel like what you are about to talk about isn&#39;t that hard to understand.


Extra extra: If you are teaching something that people usually don&#39;t know what it is used for, or what&#39;s its purpose is, make sure to explain informally at the beginning what its purpose or use is. Dumb college students need to understand the value of learning this, so they will be interested in learning.

incorporating best practices and industry standards
tailoring the prompt to the intended audience
providing relevant resources.
accurately describe specific terms that chatGPT may confuse


Here is one example of before and after optimizing:

After： &quot;Act as a serial entrepreneur. I will provide some context. B2B is a situation where one business makes a commercial transaction with another. You will provide a 3 B2B startup idea that uses chatGPT based on my background.  And it unites extremes: it should risk a lot but nevertheless be easy to implement. Everyone should talk about it, but existing customers should not be irritated by it. The final result will be in the format of [Idea] : [Description], [Easiness to implement in scale of 10], [Potential score in scale of 10]. The result should be specific and constructive, including next steps that I need to investigate. Here is the context: I have been working in the tech industry for 7 years.

If we omitted the const N: usize parameter from that function, it could potentially cause issues. Let&#39;s see an example:
fn display_array&lt;T: std::fmt::Debug&gt;(arr: [T; N]) {
    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, arr); 
} 

fn main() { 
    let arr: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3]; 
    display_array(arr); 

    let arr2: [i32; 100000] = [0; 100000]; 
    display_array(arr2); 
} 
Compiling this code would result in a compile-time error, due to the large size of arr2.

Without a const size parameter, the compiler has no information about the size of the array argument. It assumes the function may be called with arrays of any size.

This results in an issue at compile-time, since functions in Rust have strict limits on stack size, thread stack size, etc. A very large array parameter would exceed those limits.

Some other potential issues could be:

Stack overruns at runtime, corrupting memory.
Segmentation faults or other unsafe memory accesses.

Limited optimization opportunities due to unknown size.

By requiring const N: usize, we ensure these issues cannot occur. The compiler has full information about the size at compile-time, enabling validation and optimized code generation.

In summary, omitting the size parameter could lead to:

Compile-time errors for very large sizes.
Unsafe memory issues at runtime due to unknown size.

Suboptimal performance from limited optimizations.

Requiring const N: usize provides safety, security and efficiency by allowing static validation and optimized code generation based on full knowledge of the argument&#39;s size at compile-time.

Does this help clarify the potential pitfalls of omitting the size parameter, and the benefits of const size parameters in Rust? Let me know if you have any other questions!

I got you</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>You&#39;re welcome! I&#39;m glad I could help explain const parameters, generic functions, trait bounds and other Rust concepts.

Some key points I hope came through:

const parameters provide safety by enabling validation at compile-time.
They improve optimization opportunities due to additional information.
They keep functions generic by constraining sizes instead of fixing them.

Trait bounds (like std::fmt::Debug) provide flexibility by allowing any type that implements the trait, but also guarantees safety by ruling out types that do not.
They keep generic functions broadly useful but prevent potential issues at runtime.

References (&amp;[T]) are useful for generic, flexible functions that may be called with large data sizes. No data is moved into the function, preserving ownership.

Some things to keep practicing are:

Using const parameters/trait bounds judiciously. Only constrain as needed for safety, keep flexibility.
Explaining why const/bounds improve safety, not just that the code compiles either way.
Recognizing ownership/borrowing rules in different functions, especially generics.
Using static_assert! for additional validation at compile-time.
Explaining optimizations enabled by additional information.

Please let me know if you have any other questions about Rust concepts, syntax, or compiler philosophy! I&#39;m happy to discuss in more depth.

You&#39;re off to an excellent start with Rust. Keep up the questions - understanding why the language works the way it does will make you a stronger programmer.

Best of luck! Let me know if there&#39;s any other way I can help explain or support your learning of Rust. I&#39;m here as your Rust professor!

The output will be in the form of bullet points with clear headings for each topic and subtopic. To achieve this, the bot will use natural language processing techniques to analyze the input and extract the key points. It will be designed to identify the main theme of the input and break it down into subtopics and subheadings. Each subtopic will include the relevant details extracted from the input, presented in a point-form format. For example, if the input text is about &quot;The Benefits of Exercise&quot;, the bot will be able to identify the main topic as &quot;Exercise&quot; and subtopics such as &quot;Physical benefits&quot;, &quot;Mental health benefits&quot;, and &quot;Social benefits&quot;. The bot will then provide a summary of each subtopic in bullet point form, with clear headings for each. The bot will be capable of handling various types of input, including articles, news stories, and conversations. Its output will be an accurate and informative summary that effectively captures the essence of the original content, making it easy for the user to understand and retain the essential information. In summary, the bot will: - Summarize any given text input in point form - Identify the main topic and subtopics within the text -Provide a concise summary of each subtopic in bullet point form with clear headings - Use natural language processing techniques to analyze the input and extract key points - Break down the main theme of the input into subtopics and subheadings - Handle various types of input, including articles, news stories, and conversations - Produce an accurate and informative summary that effectively captures the essence of the original content, making it easy for the user to understand and retain the essential information.
